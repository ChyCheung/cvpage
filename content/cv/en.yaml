          As a self-taught explorer in computer technology, I am passionate about the application of computer graphics and front-end interaction design. Although it is not my current job, it is definitely my area of interest. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Chongqing University of Technology. During my time at university, I was introduced to computer graphics and game engine development through my roommate's influence. Additionally, due to my close friend's persistent recommendations, I became quite familiar with the field of front-end development. After graduation, I have been dedicated to learning and researching game design/development, front-end web design/development, and game engine technology. I hope to achieve success and make significant contributions in these fields in the future.
